Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt
	disable_splash=1: This line disables the rainbow splash screen that appears on booting your Raspberry Pi OS. It is also present in other raspberry Linux distro.
	dtoverlay=disable-bt: This line disables Bluetooth connections in your system. Therefore, if your project utilizes Bluetooth, you shouldn’t add this.
	boot_delay=0: By default, this value is set to 1second if not specified.
Delete the 'splash' parameter from /boot/cmdline.txt

**** Questions ****
How should we attach the pins/wires to the MPRLS sensor?
The G2 sensor is going to need a Shunt
	OR THIS :D https://www.adafruit.com/product/904

RaspberryPi boot tests
1) BEFORE I2C
	9.29 to kernal
	31.37 to desktop
	
Getting i2c going
	RPi Configuration -> Interfaces -> I2C On
	sudo pip3 install smbus2    (https://pypi.org/project/smbus2/)
	sudo reboot
	Install Adafruit CircuitPython Libs
		sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-lis3dh   (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle)
		sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mprls  (https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/mprls/en/latest/index.html)
		sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-tca9548a (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/circuitpython-python)
		sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ds3231 (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds3231-precision-rtc-breakout/circuitpython)
Solder and wire the MPRLS sensor
Run sudo i2cdetect -y 1
	Outputs at 0x18
python3 tankpressure-test.py
	---> Errno 121 Remote I/O
	Install adafruit-extended-bus
		sudo pip3 install adafruit-extended-bus
		Didn't work
	Tried adding >5 second delay, not it
	Modify the baudrate
		sudo nano /boot/config.txt
			dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
		also tried 50,000. Nothing.

Updated raspi-config
Enabled i2c, again
Run sudo i2cdetect -y 1
	Outputs at 0x18
sudo python3 tankpressure-test.py
	WORKS! Reads ~1016 hPa. My phone reads 1013.1 hPa. Success!

3-19-23 -> 3-21-23
	Used the i2c mutliplexer
	Success, used https://github.com/StevensRockSat-C-2022-23/sensor-tests/blob/main/MPRLS/multiple-pressures.py

Research on sleep timings
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1133857/how-accurate-is-pythons-time-sleep
	https://pythonspot.com/sleep/
	It seems we should sleep 1ms less than we want
	Perhaps we use a loop to check time instead of sleeping?
	
Research on batteries
	https://www.wired.com/2012/10/could-you-start-your-car-with-d-cell-batteries/
	Internal resistance of a D-cell is ~0.2Ω. So, with 10 in a row, 15V / 2Ω is 7.5A max draw. That's enough for us
		10 D-cells is 3.75 lb

RTC Setup
	Install CircuitPython for DS3231 (sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ds3231) (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds3231-precision-rtc-breakout/circuitpython)

Flash one of the Jetson Nano MicroSDs (the red & black one) with 32-bit Raspbian (standard)
Issues running all the transistors at once. I think it's something to do with the pull down resistance?
	v=ir
		12 = 0.05 * r
		r = 240
		5 = 0.4 * r
		r = 12.5
		
	PARKER MAIN RESISTOR TESTING
		270 ohm pulldown, 3000 ohm to transistor -> 3 mA DOESN'T WORK
		680 ohm, 3000 ohm to transistor -> 35 mA WORKS ON LATER TESTS
		1500 ohm, 3000 ohm to transistor -> 67 mA WORKS
		NO PULLDOWN, 3000 ohm to transistor -> 95 mA WORKS
		
		PD: 680, Tran: 3000
			35mA & 0.937V idle
			200 mA pull NO ACTUATION
			
		PD: 680, Tran: 1500
			60mA & 0.96V idle
			281 mA pull
			Sometimes misses the first actuation as it builds up current draw
			
		PD: 680, Tran: 1000
			90mA -> inf & 0.90V idle
			300 mA pull
			
		PD: 680, Tran: 270
			180mA, asymptotic idle
			377 mA pull
		
			
		PD: 270, Tran: 1500
			0mA idle
			270 mA pull
			
		PD: 150, Tran: 1500
			0mA idle
			258 mA pull
			
	We determined that the min amp pull of the 11/25/26 is somewhere between 200-250 mA

Turn on i2c and turn off splash screen in config
Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt
	disable_splash=1: This line disables the rainbow splash screen that appears on booting your Raspberry Pi OS. It is also present in other raspberry Linux distro.
	dtoverlay=disable-bt: This line disables Bluetooth connections in your system. Therefore, if your project utilizes Bluetooth, you shouldn’t add this.
	boot_delay=0: By default, this value is set to 1second if not specified.
Remove Plymouth (sudo apt purge --remove plymouth)
sudo raspi-config
	System
		Disable network at boot
sudo reboot

When we boot, it shuts down immediately
	This is bc of NTP grabbing a time more forward than 10 minutes into the "future" (the time since last ntp)
WE STILL HEAR A VALVE CLICK WHEN POWER IS UNPLUGGED
	Sounds like the park
	
batteries 22.02 V -> 21.9 V

batteries 21.9 V -> 21.5 V

Testing new Tran resistor on Parer
		PD: 680, Tran: 470
			164 mA, asymptotic idle
			383 mA pull
			Did it miss a couple of the sampling activations? (I heard other valves fire for collctions 2&3, but no power pulled on the Parker)
batteries 21.5 V -> 21.0 V
